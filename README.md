SQL Project, Barebones Full-Stack App that  Interacts with PSQL Server
Project done with classmate Xin Chen. This is a protoptype for a full-stack web app called Foodie Buddy. The project is built using Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL. The database was temporarily set up on Google Cloud.

**Project Description:**
Our application is a management system for people who want to share their private cooked
dishes in their own kitchens with others and make new friends. The application includes
information about Person , Dishes brought to the party, Reviews for parties, Party , and
Activities held in parties. Through the application, anyone can be the host of a food
party and post the invitation on the application page so that other people can join the party.
The host will decide on the details of the party, such as whether a monetary contribution is
necessary to help with expenses, how many people can attend, what he/she will cook and
whether other people should bring their own dishes. Every guest must be approved by the
host to join the party. Every user of the application has a profile page and parties are rated
by its guests.
